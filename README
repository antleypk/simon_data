Welcome to the etsy store analyzer v1.1.1

To operate the application, first clone the repo.

After cloning the repo navigate to application folder.

Once in the src folder, execute 'app.sh' -> "you@yourmachine$ ./app.sh"

This will call two python files: 'scraper.py, and analyzer.py'

        scraper.py: builds lists of companies to do anaylsis on. It saves
    the list in /application/data/shops_epocTimestamp.

        analyzer.py: Finds the distriubtion of words found for a specific shop.
    It will either get the most recent list of shops, or can also take a timestamp
    as positional argument $1.  analyzer.py saves the results at application/data/distriubtion_epocTimestamp
