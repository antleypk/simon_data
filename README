Welcome to the etsy store analyzer v1.0.0

To operate the application, first clone the repo.

After cloning the repo navigate to application folder.

!!You must go to /application/secretdotkey and convert it to the proper file format to run the application!!

Once in the src folder, execute 'app.sh' -> "you@yourmachine$ ./app.sh"

This will call two python files: 'scraper.py', and 'analyzer.py'

        scraper.py: builds lists of companies to do analysis on. It saves
    the list in /application/data/shops_epocTimestamp.

        analyzer.py: finds the distribution of words found for a specific shop.
    It will either get the most recent list of shops, or can also take a epoch_timestamp
    as positional argument $1. The timestamp must be one from /application/data/shops_epocTimestamp.csv  
    analyzer.py saves the results at /application/data/distribution_epocTimestamp 

The python files can be called multiple times; they do not need to be called together.

scraper.py must run at least one time before analyzer.py can return meaningful results. 

Due to relative file paths all files must be run from inside the application directory.
